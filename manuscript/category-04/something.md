## Intro

FIXME: PROJECT OVERVIEW

- Crossplane is an open-source Kubernetes add-on for managing and composing infrastructure from multiple clouds.

FIXME: THE PROBLEM IT ADDRESSES

- It simplifies complex cloud infrastructure setup and management across multiple service providers.

FIXME: THE APPROACH TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM

- Crossplane uses Kubernetes-style resources to provision and manage cloud services and infrastructure.

FIXME: USAGE

- Install Crossplane onto your Kubernetes cluster using Helm or a package manager.
- Define your cloud resources using Crossplane's custom resource definitions (CRDs).
- Apply configurations to cluster to provision cloud services with `kubectl apply`.
- Compose your own infrastructure platforms using Crossplane's composition engine.
- Manage infrastructure alongside applications by integrating with continuous delivery systems.

FIXME: EXAMPLES

- Provision a managed PostgreSQL instance on AWS, GCP, or Azure using Crossplane.
- Bundle cloud services into custom platforms for easy consumption by developers.
- Automate creation of secure and compliant Kubernetes clusters across clouds.
- Define and enforce policies for cloud resource usage within your organization.
